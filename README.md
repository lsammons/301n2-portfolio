# Laura Sammons professional online presence
# Web Design and Web Development Portfolio

This portfolio site that will highlight my projects and  interests, and showcase my skills to potential employers or clients.

This will be a static portfolio site to represent my personal online presence.

## User Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
These user stories will guide my development:
 1. As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
  - As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
  - As a developer, I want a contact form so visitors can contact me via my site.
 2. As the creator, I want the page to link to my social, LinkedIn and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
  - As the creator, I want a page to display a html version of my resume, a downloadable PDF, and a link to my LinkedIn profile.   The "print" version of the html page resume should have a print style sheet.
 3. As a visitor, I want the site to look reasonable, so that I can read it on any device.
  - As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest projects on top so that I can easily see the developers recent work.
  - As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on projects to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.
  - As a visitor, I want the portfolio project description to include the technology details for the project.
  - As a visitor, I want to be able to contact this person from their website directly.
