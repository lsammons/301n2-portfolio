# 04 Templates and Typography

# User Stories: MVP

1. As a developer, I want to use Handlebars for my project template, so that I can include new projects more easily.
  - As a developer, I want my CSS styles to follow SMACSS organization, so that I know where to look for creating and editing styles.
2. As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.

# TO DO:
  1. How to get the .heading-group-h1 to scale in size, when it gets smaller?  For mobile view?
    - ANSWER?  Write that in the mobile styles?
    - WHEN IT IS in Mobile view, put the hamburger menu in place where it makes sense and make the text get smaller?
  2. Drop-down chooser, what to do?
    - style?
  3. Without the float-left, I could have a stacking of gallery one on top of the other.
    - use this for the very smallest of the portfolio
    - then: use 2 colums for larger,
    - and three for largest.
  4. In the JSON, add a SHORT tagline description of the portfolio piece which should go below the image... just a few words. This can be styled for the "before" the click.
  5. Social Media ICONS on my portfolio page --
    1. Twitter - can go to my twitter account for developer
    2. Facebook - create a fb account for my development
    3. Linked In - should link to my online resume & connections
  6. Add a BLOG to this portfolio.
    1. Blog about my experience of going through CodeFellows!
    2. And blog about the new techniques I'm learning, old techniques. I could share tips and such.
  7. Add a RESOURCES page to this portfolio.
    1. Link to the places I go to get information about web dev.
