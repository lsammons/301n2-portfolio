# 04 Templates and Typography

# User Stories: MVP

1. As a developer, I want to use Handlebars for my project template, so that I can include new projects more easily.
  - As a developer, I want my CSS styles to follow SMACSS organization, so that I know where to look for creating and editing styles.
2. As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.

# TO DO:
  1. How to get the .heading-group-h1 to scale in size, when it gets smaller?  For mobile view?
    - ANSWER?  Write that in the mobile styles?
    - WHEN IT IS in Mobile view, put the hamburger menu in place where it makes sense and make the text get smaller?
