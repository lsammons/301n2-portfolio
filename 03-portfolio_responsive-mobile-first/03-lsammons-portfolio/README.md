# Laura Sammons
# Web Design and Web Development Portfolio / MVC Blog
This portfolio site that will highlight my projects and  interests, and showcase my skills to potential employers or clients. It will represent my personal online presence.

# New User Stories:Mobile-First and Responsive Design
  1. As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
    - As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
    - As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.

  2. As the creator, I want to be able to indicate solo vs team projects in the title of the project. 



## Old Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
These user stories will guide my development:
 1. As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
  - As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
  - As a developer, I want a contact form so visitors can contact me via my site.
 2. As the creator, I want the page to link to my social, LinkedIn and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
  - As the creator, I want a page to display a html version of my resume, a downloadable PDF, and a link to my LinkedIn profile.   The "print" version of the html page resume should have a print style sheet.
  - As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
    - This means my links to NOT navigate to a new page.
    - Instead, my "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
    - You can use data- attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab
    - Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.
 3. As a visitor, I want the site to look reasonable, so that I can read it on any device.
  - As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest projects on top so that I can easily see the developers recent work.
  - As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on projects to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.
  - As a visitor, I want the portfolio project description to include the technology details for the project.
  - As a visitor, I want to be able to contact this person from their website directly.
4.  As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph so that I can easily scroll though the whole list.
  - As a reader, I want to click the "More" button so that I can expand the entire description.
  - As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me.
  - As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.
