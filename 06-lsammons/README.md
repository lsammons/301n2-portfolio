# 06 Portfolio Assignment
  - AJAX and JSON
  - Asynchronous connections and standardized data formats? This all sounds like a serious upgrade to our application logic! Let's see what you can do with the app, once we apply these concepts.

# Class 06 Portfolio assignment - README
User Stories: MVP
  - As a developer, I want to store my project data in a .json file, so that I can keep it organized.
  - As a developer, I want to retrieve that source data file asynchronously, so that my app logic gets the data just when I need it.

  - User Stories: Stretch Goals

  - As a reader, I only want to have to fetch data when it's updated (and keep it cached locally), so that I don't make unneeded AJAX calls. (eTag)

Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
  - Continue to follow good SMACSS principles.
  - Be sure to use the correct jQuery method for each AJAX call.
  - Be thoughtful when functions are executed asynchronously. This is a major source of bugs!


DONE:
  ADD BACKUPS of JQUERY and HANDLEBARS in file structure



# 05 Notes:

# 05 Templates and Typography
# LAURA NOTES

# User Stories: MVP

1. As a developer, I want to use Handlebars for my project template, so that I can include new projects more easily.
  - As a developer, I want my CSS styles to follow SMACSS organization, so that I know where to look for creating and editing styles.
2. As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.

# TO DO:

  2. Drop-down chooser, what to do?
    - style?
  3. Without the float-left, I could have a stacking of gallery one on top of the other.
    - use this for the very smallest of the portfolio
    - then: use 2 colums for larger,
    - and three for largest.
  4. In the JSON, add a SHORT tagline description of the portfolio piece which should go below the image... just a few words. This can be styled for the "before" the click.
  5. Social Media ICONS on my portfolio page --
    1. Twitter - can go to my twitter account for developer
    2. Facebook - create a fb account for my development
    3. Linked In - should link to my online resume & connections
  6. Add a BLOG to this portfolio.
    1. Blog about my experience of going through CodeFellows!
    2. And blog about the new techniques I'm learning, old techniques. I could share tips and such.
  7. Add a RESOURCES page to this portfolio.
    1. Link to the places I go to get information about web dev.
  8. Footer ICONS
    2. include those as CSS bg, or iconmoons
