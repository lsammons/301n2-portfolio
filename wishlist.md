MVP for 02:
## User Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

1. As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
 - This means your links to NOT navigate to a new page.
 - Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
 - You can use data- attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab
 - Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.
   - As the creator, I want a page to display a html version of my resume, a downloadable PDF, and a link to my LinkedIn profile.   The "print" version of the html page resume should have a print style sheet.
2. As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.


- As a visitor, I want the portfolio project description to include the technology details for the project.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to contact this person from their website directly.
